# Projects

Hello!

If you've come across my respository, then chances are you're a potential future employer that was referred over here. I'm a completely self-taught coder with an emphasis on C++, and striving to learn more every day. Here, you will find every project that I've worked on in my free time; from the very beginnings of my programming journey, to what I'm pushing out today. Hopefully, this repository can give you a good idea of my evolution as a hopeful software developer, and whether or not I would be a good fit for your workplace. 

Regardless of what your decision may be, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to look over my profile, and I hope to hear from you soon. 


Have a wonderful day!
-Charles Vincent Marchuk
